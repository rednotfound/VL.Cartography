.SYNOPSIS
    The package repositories and NuGet feeds this pack needs, in one place.

.DESCRIPTION
    This pack builds nothing. It has no dist\ and no deps\ of its own - every node its chapters use
    comes from a sibling repository, so opening or compiling a chapter needs SIX folders on
    --package-repositories and three NuGet sources for restore.

    That list lives here and nowhere else, because it has already been the problem twice. In
    vl-mapsui the same list was written out in two scripts and typed by hand a third time; two
    launches were lost to it, each failing with an error that named something entirely different
    ("The referenced symbol source 'Mapsui.dll' couldn't be found" for a missing deps\, "Missing
    package: VL.NetTopologySuite" plus twenty-five ambiguous Point candidates for a missing dist\).
    A repository folder that does not exist is IGNORED SILENTLY by vvvv, which is precisely how a
    missing folder disguises itself as a broken package.

.OUTPUTS
    A hashtable: Repositories (string[]), Feeds (string[]), Missing (string[]).
    Missing is not empty when a sibling has not been packed - the caller decides whether that is
    fatal, because it usually is.
